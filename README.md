## Hi there 👋

I'm Fran. Here's some headlines:

### ![R](https://www.r-project.org/favicon-32x32.png) 📦 development

- I 💙 making data tools as R packages
- My specialisms are working with APIs, and geospatial or demographic projects
- I am tidyverse-centric. I just think dplyr, ggplot2 and purrr in particular are fantastic toolkits
- I have an [R-universe][runiv] presence
- Other favourite packages include `{sf}` (and don't sleep on [`{sfext}`][sfext]), `{cli}` and

### Preferences

- I prefer user-powered and open products and platforms where possible - see the [indieweb principles][iw] for example&hellip;
- &hellip; hence I try to avoid closed and [enshittified][ensh] platforms where I can. I'm also pretty averse to using LLMs - I don't think they are going to do us good as a society
- I'm moving a lot of my personal repositories to 🌄 [Codeberg][cberg]
- I try to prioritise ♻️ [reproducibility][rap] in my work
- I favour the ![lambda symbol][λ] functional programming paradigm.

### Learning

- I'm really enjoying learning [Julia][jlorg]
- I might get tempted to do some Rust development to support R, just for fun, [like Josiah does][jpyt]
- I find [Tidy Tuesday][tt] and [Advent of Code][aoc] really useful games for helping me learn stuff.

### I'm currently working on...

- getting into the habit of documenting my learning and writing things up in a blog
- writing more effective unit tests and developing in a test-driven or behaviour-driven way
- developing my reflective practice as a data professional.

### Other skills etc

- I have quite a bit of experience with HTML and S/CSS, though I'm pretty old school and not up to speed with modern web dev workflows. I have a soft spot for [Eleventy][11ty]
- I use Windows for work but I'd rather be using Arch Linux

### Away from screens

I have been mostly

- 🌾🌾 mowing with my scythe
- 🎶📖 singing shapenote tunes
- 🏕️🚴🏻‍♂️ doing random adventures
- 🧑🏻‍🌾🥬 trying to get edible things to grow in my allotment, and
- 🏏🎾 playing some sports (honestly) _very_ badly.
